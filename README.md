## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema
The dataset consists of five main tables:
- **stores** ‚Üí Information about Apple stores (ID, name, city, country)  
- **category** ‚Üí Product categories (ID, name)  
- **products** ‚Üí Product details (ID, name, launch date, price)  
- **sales** ‚Üí Transactions (sale date, store ID, product ID, quantity)  
- **warranty** ‚Üí Warranty claims (claim date, repair status)  

üëâ See `schema.sql` for table definitions.

## Business Questions Solved
- Category with most warranty claims in the last two years  
- Probability of warranty claims after purchase (by country)  
- Yearly growth ratio for each store  
- Correlation between product price and warranty claims  
- Store with highest % of ‚ÄúPaid Repaired‚Äù claims  
- Monthly running totals of sales and trend comparison  
- Product lifecycle sales segmentation

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Monthly sales tracking, multi-year performance, and lifecycle segmentation  
- **Window Functions**: Running totals, year-over-year (YoY) growth, lag/lead comparisons, and ranking  
- **Complex Joins & Aggregations**: Identifying least-selling products, top categories, and unit trends  
- **Correlation & Segmentation**: Analyzing product price vs. warranty claims and lifecycle-based sales trends

## ‚ùì Key Business Questions Solved
- Which store sold the most units in the past year?  
- What is the least-selling product in each country each year?  
- How many warranty claims were filed within 180 days of purchase?  
- What % of warranty claims were rejected?  
- Which product category had the most claims in the last 2 years?  
- What is the monthly running total of sales for each store (last 4 years)?  
- What is the YoY growth ratio for each store?  
- What is the probability of warranty claims after purchase (by country)?  
- How do sales vary across the product lifecycle (0‚Äì6, 6‚Äì12, 12‚Äì18, 18+ months)?
